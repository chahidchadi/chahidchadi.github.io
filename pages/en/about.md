# Erel Segal-Halevi - Academic Homepage

I am a tenure-track lecturer in [Ariel university][arielcs], computer science department. 
My main research goal is to develop algorithms for making human society better and fairer. In particular, I develop [fair division algorithms][1] and [truthful auction mechanisms][2]. 

In the past I did research in natural language processing - [English negotiation][4] and [Hebrew morphology][5]. 
The inspiration to research these diverse topics comes from the [Bible][7].

I am looking for students for M.Sc., Ph.D. and post-doc positions. The requirements are: (1) an aspiration for making the world better, (2) creative imagination, and (3) excellent mathematical skills. Both Israeli and international students are welcome.

For some open questions I find particularly interesting, see my [wishlist][8].

In addition to research, I have many years of experience [programming in various languages][6].
