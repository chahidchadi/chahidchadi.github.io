## About Me

I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at [Moulay Ismail University](http://www.umi.ac.ma/en/), specializing in numerical analysis and partial differential equations (PDEs). My research focuses on innovative approaches to solving complex mathematical problems, particularly through the application of machine learning techniques to traditional mathematical challenges.

## Research Interests

My primary research goal is to develop cutting-edge methods for solving PDEs using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). My current work encompasses:

1. **Application of PINNs to PDEs**: Exploring PINNs as a novel approach to solve various types of partial differential equations.
2. **Convergence Analysis**: Developing rigorous mathematical proofs for the convergence of PINNs in solving specific PDEs.
3. **Computational Optimization**: Investigating the use of domain decomposition methods in conjunction with PINNs to mitigate computational complexity and enhance efficiency.
