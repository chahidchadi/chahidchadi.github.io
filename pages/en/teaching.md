# Ideas for student projects

Below are some ideas for projects. Some of them can be good as a final project for undergraduates. Others can be good for MA or PhD students.

## Projects in fair division

The projects below involve theoretic research that may result in writing a paper for a conference or journal.

1. Compare fair division in the Bible and later Jewish sources to mathematical fair division algorithms. For a journal such as [BDD](http://www.biupress.co.il/website/index.asp?category=56).

1. Develop a new algorithm for fair division of electricity, in villages where the supply is not sufficient for all households. See [Fair load-shedding algorithms](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/0220.pdf).

1. Develop an algorithm for fair division with [differential privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_Privacy). See [How to share a cake with a secret agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06913).

1. Develop an algorithm for two-dimensional fair division with discrete goods. See [Discrete Envy-free Division of Necklaces and Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02132).

For more advanced topics, see my [wishlist](/pages/en/wishlist/).

## Projects in text analysis

The projects below combine research and programming. They require some experience in natural language processing and Jewish texts.

1. Automatic clustering of Bible commentaries on verses: for each verse, display the commentaries in groups, based on their contents.

1. Automatic generation of questions on the Bible and other texts. See [Textia](https://github.com/erelsgl/textia).

## Projects in programming

The projects below involve understanding and improving existing open-source projects.

1. Add computational geometry algorithms to [GeoGebra](https://dev.geogebra.org/trac).

1. Construct a system that will help politicians (e.g. in the parliament or municipal council) to quickly poll their supporters regarding upcoming votes. See [Open Knesset](https://oknesset.org/).
