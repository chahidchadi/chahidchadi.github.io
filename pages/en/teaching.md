In 2023 I teach the following courses:

1. Winter: [Economic Algorithms][alg-econ] and [Programming Research Algorithms][alg-research].

1. Spring: [System Programming (C++)][cpp] and  [Game Development][gamedev].

In addition, I offer several kinds of [annual projects][projects].

Availability is limited. To suggest a project, please send an email with your uptodate grade sheet to: davidesh@ariel.ac.il


## For graduate students

Students who studied the economic algorithms course (or a similar course in a different university)
are invited to submit proposals for M.Sc., Ph.D. and post-doc research for the research program [fair division: from theory to practice][research] and similar topics. The requirements are: (1) an aspiration for making the world better, (2) creative imagination, and (3) excellent mathematical skills. Both Israeli and international students are welcome.
Stipends are available for excellent students. Availability is limited.
