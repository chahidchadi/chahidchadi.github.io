## Teaching in 2021

1. Winter: [Economic Algorithms][alg5781] and  [Game Development][gamedev5781].

1. Spring: [System Programming (C++)][cpp5781].


## Student projects in 2021

I offer several kinds of projects:

1. [Developing and implementing fair division algorithms][fairdivision]. Open for students taking the [economic algorithms][alg5781] course. Can be extended to an MA thesis.

1. Developing an original research or educational game. Open for students taking the [game development][gamedev2021] course.

1. Contribution to open-source projects: [you can find some examples here][opensource], or suggest your own ideas. Open to all students.
