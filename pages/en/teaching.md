## For undergraduate students

In 2021 I teach the following courses:

1. Winter: [Economic Algorithms][alg5781] and  [Game Development][gamedev5781].

1. Spring: [System Programming (C++)][cpp5781].

In addition, I offer several kinds of projects:

1. [Developing and implementing fair division algorithms][fairdivision]. Open for students taking the [economic algorithms][alg5781] course. Can be extended to an MA thesis.

1. Developing an original research or educational game. Open for students taking the [game development][gamedev5781] course.

1. Contribution to open-source projects: [you can find some examples here][opensource], or suggest your own ideas. Open to all students.

Availability is limited. To suggest a project, please send an email with your uptodate grade sheet to: davidesh@ariel.ac.il


## For graduate students

Students who studied the economic algorithms course (or a similar course in a different university)
are invited to submit proposals for M.Sc., Ph.D. and post-doc research for the research program [fair division: from theory to practice][research] and similar topics. The requirements are: (1) an aspiration for making the world better, (2) creative imagination, and (3) excellent mathematical skills. Both Israeli and international students are welcome.
Stipends are available for excellent students. Availability is limited.
