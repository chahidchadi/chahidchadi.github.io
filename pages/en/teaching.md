All the material for my courses is available in Hebrew below.

1. Undergraduate project topics: [2020][projects5780]. For master and Ph.D.  topics, see my [wishlist](/pages/en/wishlist/).

1. Economic algorithms (mechanism design): [Spring 2018][alg5778], [Spring 2019][alg5779].

1. C++ and memory Structure: [Spring 2018][cpp5778], [Spring 2019][cpp5779].

1. Object-oriented programming:  [Winter 2018][oop5778].
